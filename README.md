# Google Search Homepage

A recreation of the Google Home Page. The index.html file contains the necessary placements of the words and icons using basic web development tools such as div, forms, lists, classes, etc. The style.css takes the elements from index.html and stylizes it to look similar to the original home page. This file shows how to distinguish between classes and ids and how to manipulate both.
